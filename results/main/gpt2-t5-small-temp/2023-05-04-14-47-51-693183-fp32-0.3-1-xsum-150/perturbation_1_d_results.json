Mr Buhari, 74, left for London nearly five years ago - and a trip to the UK for treatment this year. His absence has led to some anxiety in Nigeria, Nigeria, and India regarding the economy, with people speculating that he will be able to resume his duties. Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo is acting president, and has been widely praised for his handling of the country's economic crisis, following a sharp fall in the price of oil, its major export. Mr Buhari took about seven weeks of medical treatment in January, in order to return to the UK . When he returned home in March, he hinted that he had undergone a blood transfusion, but did not disclose his illness. He flew again to London on Tuesday for further treatment, and has not indicated when he will return.
